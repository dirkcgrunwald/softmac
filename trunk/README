This file describes the basics of Softmac.

Softmac is an extension to the Madwifi [http://madwifi.sourceforge.org] driver
for the Atheros 802.11a/b/g networking cards that provides more control over
the MAC layer. In particular, Softmac lets you control

* The transmitted contents of any given frame, aside from three mandatory 
  bytes in the header and an automatically appended checksum
* The receiption of packets, including those that fail to pass the checksum
* The timing of when packets are transmitted 

This allows researchers to build new mac protocols using relatively 
inexpensive networking hardware.
